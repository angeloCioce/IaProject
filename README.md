# spring-ai-in-action

In this project the goal is integrate my database with open ai and use it to generate response.

1. U can give the program several question like:
     - Every type of question for example what is the tallest mountain? and give u a response with links, ecc. Example for links
       u search for something accademical like programming and openai returns you links, diagrams, part of code, ecc.
     - U can based on a genre and a year search for whatever u want like film, games, books, ecc.
     - U can genrate images based on a prompt but this function it's being tested as it doesn't work as it should.
  
2. U can give the program your db and the openai api analyze the data retrived and in base of that helps u do a lot of things
   like:
      -Do query for you and retrive u a response u can manipulate after.
      -Give u hint how to do things with the data
      -In future give u graphs, for example a graph of earn/loss money based on all product or a portion o product.

# things-i-want-to-add-in-future-update

After adjusting the image generatore, i want to create a method that take in a image, text, ecc. and give me out a graph, table, ecc. or for example if we talk about arts or something, capable of generate images from that or recognize the artist behind the image or describe it.
